# Video-Games-Insights
The repo will give us the idea of Video Games sales basic analysis and EDA.

**What is the project about?**
We are all playing games in our daily lives.Before the android mobile games reached into the market, we used to make play on PC and many different consoles. Many of the consoles
are out of the market due to the new ones.The main objective is to show the preferences of games of people in different years and how more Genre of games are made for following
age type. It also gives us the idea and why do we play more action games when we grow up. 

**What action did I take?**
I found the relationship between different features and also did dimensionality reduction to the less necessary columns.Also z-score was used in some particular columns so
that we can do a fair comparison. Along will showing the relationship, I also showed the visualization of the relationship between them.

->Setting up the environment
->Cleaning the data
->Perform basic descriptive analysis from the features
->Provide necessary visualization
->Dimensionality reduction

From the results it is found that PC games are always available, but console games are not always available since new consoles are released in the market. 
It is also seen that there are less sales after 2011, that might be the case of Android games in the market where it needs a mobile device for making that game, but
we did not consider it.
